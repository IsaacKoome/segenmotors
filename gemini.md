That's fantastic news that the chatbot is now working! The gemini-2.5-flash model name likely resolved the 404 error. Now, let's make it feel truly custom and intelligent for Segen Motors. This is where prompt engineering and contextual information injection come into play. To make the chatbot understand your company, location, and inventory, and to provide tailored advice based on a buyer's budget, we need to feed it this information strategically.


Created a file to store static company info for context integration, enabling the chatbot to use Segen Motors’ details during conversations. Next, will incorporate inventory data.

I located the car data file as 'lib_carData_with_images.ts'. I'll extract inventory info from it to incorporate into the chatbot context for improved responses.

I've renamed the data file, extracted all car inventory details, and appended it to the chatbot context for better personalized responses. Next, I will update the chat component to handle full conversation history.

The Gemini AI-powered chatbot has been enhanced to be contextually aware of Segen Motors' operations, location, and car inventory. It can now provide more personalized advice, including budget-based recommendations.
Here's what has been implemented:
Company Information and Location: A chatbotContext.ts file (lib/chatbotContext.ts) has been created, containing detailed information about Segen Motors, including its name, description, location (Nairobi, Kenya), contact details, mission, and services. This information forms the core of the chatbot's understanding of the company.
Car Inventory Integration: The allCars data from lib/carData.ts is now dynamically summarized and included in the chatbot's instructions. This allows the chatbot to reference your current inventory when responding to user queries.
Enhanced API Route (/api/chat): The Next.js API route (app/api/chat/route.ts) has been updated to:
Import and utilize the fullChatbotInstructions (which includes both company details and inventory summary) as part of the initial prompt sent to the Gemini API.
Pass the entire conversation history to the Gemini API, enabling the chatbot to maintain context throughout the conversation.
The model has been set to gemini-2.5-flash, which resolved the previous 404 Not Found error.
Frontend Chatbot Components Updated: Both components/ChatWidget.tsx and app/chat/page.tsx have been modified to send the full conversation history to the /api/chat endpoint with each new message, ensuring the chatbot maintains conversational context.
To test the enhanced chatbot:
Redeploy your project to Vercel to ensure all the latest changes are live.
Access your website (https://www.segenmotors.com/ ).
Open the floating chat widget or navigate to the /chat page.
Try asking the chatbot questions like:
"What kind of cars does Segen Motors sell?"
"Where is Segen Motors located?"
"What is your mission?"
"I'm looking for a car around 1.5 million KES. What do you recommend?"
"Tell me about the Nissan Note E-power."
"What is the price of the Toyota Prado J120?"
The chatbot should now provide responses that are much more tailored to Segen Motors and its inventory. If you have any further requirements or notice any issues, please let me know!
