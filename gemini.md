Now we need to draft the app/chat/page.tsx UI. Instead of it appearing like in the chat widget, you can just make it, for user message it get's displayed from the right while the AI's message get's displayed from the left part.
You can update the chat widget also for messages to appear as so.

Then proceed with the chat interface and all just like in the chat widget but feel free to add something like colors, emojis etc or something that will make user interactions with the AI easier and fun experience.
